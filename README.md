Pair trading strategy for SPY and QQQ

This strategy is a very basic form of a type of stratiegies called pair trading. In this I have tried to find a correlation primiarily and once I extablished that. I developed a strategy to invoke my code to backtest the strategy on quantopian. 

Details about the files:
* SPX_QQQ_corr.ipynb (jupyter notebook) and SPX_QQQ_corr.py (python) files are the scource code to analyse the correlation between SPY and QQQ.
* SPY_QQQ_pairtrading_quantopian file is the source code for backtesting the strategy on quantopian. 

Anyone who'd like to access this project through quantopian to view the risk parameters, please click on the [https://www.quantopian.com/posts/spy-and-qqq-pair-trading](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/spy-and-qqq-pair-trading). 

Please feel free to use it and I sincerely, welcome suggestions and imporovements on the strategy.
